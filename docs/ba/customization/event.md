        doCommands:
            - console deop player # will run the command 'deop player' from the console, where player becomes the player name

# Join Phase

## Join Phase Games

Games that have a join phase must be "opened", then "started". While "opened" players can join and leave. You must then "start" the game. You can "open" and "start" the match by doing the command `/<event> auto`, which will open the game for 3 minutes(configurable) then start it automatically. ===Auto run=== The simplest way to make an event happen. Do it automatically, it will announce instructions every minute until it starts.

- `/<event> auto` Example: `/ffa auto`

## Opening an event

If you want to control when it opens and starts, use the commands:

- `/<event> open`
- `/<event> start` Example:
- `/ffa open`
- `/ffa start`

## Cancelling an event

- `/<event> cancel`

## Declaring a winner of a match

This is not a tournament option, but it's useful sometimes if something unexpected occurs `/arena winner <player name>`

## Examples

== Event Walkthrough Example == Lets assume that you want to change the FreeForAll to use a waiting room.

# Find the section in the config.yml that deals with FreeForAlls, freeForAll:

# Find the match stage '''onJoin'''.

# Change the option '''teleportIn''' to '''teleportWaitroom'''

# Now we need to add '''teleportIn''' to either '''onPrestart''' or '''onStart'''

# Reload the config, using '''/arena reload'''

# Add a waitroom to your ffa arena. '''/ffa alter waitroom 1'''

Example:

```
### FFA Event
freeForAll:
    preReqs:
        options: [clearInventory]
    onJoin:
        options: [teleportWaitRoom, woolTeams]
    onOpen:
        options: [pvpOff]
    onPrestart:
        options: [pvpOff, giveItems, deEnchant]
        items: # ignored if options doesnt have "giveItems"
            - iron_sword: 1
            - bow: 1
            - tnt: 3
            - arrow: 32
            - leather_helm: 1
            - leather_chest: 1
            - leather_leggings: 1
            - leather_boot: 1
            - bread: 5
    onStart:
        options: [teleportIn, pvpOn]
    onComplete:
        options: [teleportOut, clearInventory, deEnchant, undisguise]
```

== Match Walkthrough Example == Lets assume that you want to change the battleground(bg) to use a wait room. Let's also make the match start in 30 seconds so they have that much time to stay in the waitroom before starting.

# Find the section in the config.yml that deals with battlegrounds, battleground:

# Find the match stage '''onPrestart'''.

# Change the option '''teleportIn''' to '''teleportWaitroom'''

# Now we need to add '''teleportIn''' to '''onStart'''

# Reload the config, using '''/arena reload'''

# Add a waitroom to your bg arena. '''/bg alter

<arena name=""> waitroom 1'''</arena>

# add in the option secondsTillMatch:

<seconds> inside of battleground:</seconds>

Example:

```
battleground:
    secondsTillMatch: 30
    preReqs:
        options: [clearInventory]
    onOpen:
        options: [pvpOff]
    onPrestart:
        options: [pvpOff, teleportWaitroom, giveItems, deEnchant]
        items: # ignored if options doesnt have "giveItems"
            - iron_sword: 1
    onStart:
        options: [teleportIn, pvpOn]
    onComplete:
        options: [teleportOut, clearInventory, deEnchant, undisguise]
```
