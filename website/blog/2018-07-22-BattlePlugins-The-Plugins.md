List of BattlePlugins that I can remember:
BattleArena (Created in 2011)
Arena games (Late 2011-2012 was when BattleArena had a solid API and we started making extensions)
BattlePunishments
BattleTradeTown (plot management, upgradable trade town stores all automated by signs)
VirtualPlayers (pretty sick plugin, created new player instances on the server so that you could test arenas by yourself, and anything else where you need more people)
BattleShops (first trade town plugin that allowed the chests holding the items for sale to be in a completely different location than the shop)
Guilds (This wasn’t created by alkarin or I and it was made before we started calling everything “Battle-” .. Alkarin maintained it after it’s original developed left. Never released to the public, to this day I will say that this is the most advanced Guilds/factions/clan/etc plugin that I’ve ever seen. It’s a shame it never got released due to how many bugs it had and how hard it would have been to update it)
BattleProtection (Built off WorldGuard)
BattleChunks .. Originally called hCreativeChunks .. Something like that (Creative world plugin that allowed users to claim individual chunks to build on)
hUtil (Was a “frankenstein” plugin that basically fixed bugs in a lot of other plugins)
BattleCombatTag
BattleCore
BattleWars (Huge war plugin that alkarin spent about three months making under Latros’ request. It was Latros’ last attempt at “saving” Battlecraft until he passed it on to lDucks)
